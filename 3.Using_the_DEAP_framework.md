# Section 2: Solving problems with GAs

# Using the DEAP Framework
- DEAP is a powerful and flexible evolutionary computaion framework capable of solving real-life problems with GAs.
- *DEAP* stands for *Distributed Evolutionary Algorithms in Python*.
A framework that support rapid development of solutions using genetic algorithms as well as other evolutionary computational techniques.
