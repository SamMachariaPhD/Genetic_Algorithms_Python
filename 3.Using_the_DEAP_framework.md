# Section 2: Solving problems with GAs

# Using the DEAP Framework
- DEAP is a powerful and flexible evolutionary computaion framework capable of solving real-life problems with GAs.
- *DEAP* stands for *Distributed Evolutionary Algorithms in Python*.
A framework that support rapid development of solutions using genetic algorithms as well as other evolutionary computational techniques.

#### Using the creator module
The *creator* module is used as a meta-factory, and it enables existing by augmenting them with with new attributes.
- Suppose we have a class called *Employee*. Using the *creator* tool, we can extend the *Employee* class by creating a *Developer* class as follows.

``` Python
from deap import creator
creator.create("Developer", Employee, position="Developer", programmingLanguages = set)
```
