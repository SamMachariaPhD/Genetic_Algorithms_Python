### 2. Understanding the key components of GAs

#### Basic flow of a genetic algorithm

`[Start]-->[Generation Zero]-->[Selection]-->[Crossover]-->[Mutation]
-->[Individual Fitness]-->[Stopping condition met?]` <br>
`[No]-->[Go back to Selection]` <br>
`[Yes]-->[Pick Highest Fitness Individual]-->[End]`

##### Creating initial population
- Initial population is basically a set of valid solutions (individuals) chosen randomly. GAs use chromosomes to represent individuals.

##### Calculating the fitness
- To begin with, fitness function is calculated for each individual. Fitness for each individual is independent of others. Since the next iteration involves the best fitness score, GAs are hence steered by maximum/minimum value(s).
- Then Selection --> Crossover --> Mutation --> Stopping condition

##### Stopping condition
- The two common stopping conditions are:
 - A maximum number of generations have been reached.
 - There was no noticeable improvement over a couple of generations.
- Other stopping conditions include:
 - Predetermined timeout.
 - A certain budget has been depleted.
 - The best individual has taken over a portion of the population larger than a preset threshold.

##### Summary (a loop)
 - *Selection* based on *fitness function*
 - *Crossover*
 - *Mutation*
 - *Stopping* based on a *Stopping condition*

##### Selection methods
- *Roulette wheel selection* (fitness proportionate selection, *FPS*)
The probability of selecting an individual is directly proportional to its fitness value.

Each time the wheel is turned, the selection point is used to choose a single individual. This process is repeated until enough individuals are selected to fill the next generation.
- *Stochastic universal sampling* (SUS)
This method uses the Roulette wheel above but uses multiple equispaced selection points to pick many individuals once and for all. This prevents individuals with particularly high fitness score from saturating the next generation. In reference to Roulette method, this is unfair.
- Rank-based selection
Roulette method is used to sort the individuals. An individual with the lowest fitness is given a rank 1, the second lowest rank 2, and so on. New probabilities are then calculated based on these ranks as opposed to the fitness score. The wheel selection is the same as the Roulette single selection point. This eliminates individual saturation and damps large or tiny differences.
