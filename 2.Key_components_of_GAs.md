### 2. Understanding the key components of GAs

#### Basic flow of a genetic algorithm

`[Start]-->[Generation Zero]-->[Selection]-->[Crossover]-->[Mutation]
-->[Individual Fitness]-->[Stopping condition met?]` <br>
`[No]-->[Go back to Selection]` <br>
`[Yes]-->[Pick Highest Fitness Individual]-->[End]`

##### Creating initial population
- Initial population is basically a set of valid solutions (individuals) chosen randomly. GAs use chromosomes to represent individuals.

##### Calculating the fitness
- To begin with, fitness function is calculated for each individual. Fitness for each individual is independent of others. Since the next iteration involves the best fitness score, GAs are hence steered by maximum/minimum value(s).
- Then Selection --> Crossover --> Mutation --> Stopping condition

##### Stopping condition
- The two common stopping conditions are:
 - A maximum number of generations have been reached.
 - There was no noticeable improvement over a couple of generations.
- Other stopping conditions include:
 - Predetermined timeout.
 - A certain budget has been depleted.
 - The best individual has taken over a portion of the population larger than a preset threshold.

##### Summary (a loop)
 - *Selection* based on *fitness function*
 - *Crossover*
 - *Mutation*
 - *Stopping* based on a *Stopping condition*

##### Selection methods
- *Roulette wheel selection* (fitness proportionate selection, *FPS*) <br>
The probability of selecting an individual is directly proportional to its fitness value.

Each time the wheel is turned, the selection point is used to choose a single individual. This process is repeated until enough individuals are selected to fill the next generation.

- *Stochastic universal sampling* (SUS) <br>
This method uses the Roulette wheel above but uses multiple equispaced selection points to pick many individuals once and for all. This prevents individuals with particularly high fitness score from saturating the next generation. In reference to Roulette method, this is unfair.

- *Rank-based selection* <br>
Roulette method is used to sort the individuals. An individual with the lowest fitness is given a rank 1, the second lowest rank 2, and so on. New probabilities are then calculated based on these ranks as opposed to the fitness score. The wheel selection is the same as the Roulette single selection point. This eliminates individual saturation and damps large or tiny differences.

- *Fitness scalling* <br>
While rank-based selection replaces fitness score with the individual rank, fitness scaling applies a scaling transformation and replaces the fitness value with the result. A scaling transformation may take the following form:
`scaled fitness = a*(raw fitness)+b`, where a and b are constants chosen to achieve a desired range.
This method provides a moderate proportion of the roulette wheel.

- *Tournament selection* <br>
Here, two or more individuals are picked at random and the highest in fitness out of the randomly picked becomes the winner. The "two or more" picked at random is referred to as the *tournament size*. The larger the tournament size, the more chances there are of getting a high fitness individual.
In this method, the actual value of fitness may not be needed, since we can compare any two individuals to determine which one of them is better.*

##### Crossover methods
Crossover operator is aka recombination, corresponds to the biological sexual reproduction crossover (the exchange of genetic material during sexual reproduction). Whenever crossover is not applied, both parents are directly cloned into the next generation. The following methods are useful but in some cases, it might be better to use problem-specific crossover methods.
- Single-point crossover - location on the chromosomes of both parents is selected at random, then swapped.
- Two-point and k-point crossover - Two crossover points on the chromosomes are randomly selected from both parents. k positive integer, and k crossover points.
- Uniform crossover - Each gene is independently selected by randomly choosing one of the parents.
- Crossover for ordered lists
- Ordered crossover

##### Mutation methods
This is the last process to be applied in the process of applying new generation. It applies to the offspring that were created as a result of selection and crossover.
- Mutation is probability-based and usually occurs at a low probability since it has a risk of harming the performance of an individual.
