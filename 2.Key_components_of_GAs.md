### 2. Understanding the key components of GAs

#### Basic flow of a genetic algorithm

`[Start]-->[Generation Zero]-->[Selection]-->[Crossover]-->[Mutation]
-->[Individual Fitness]-->[Stopping condition met?]` <br>
`[No]-->[Go back to Selection]` <br>
`[Yes]-->[Pick Highest Fitness Individual]-->[End]`

##### Creating initial population
- Initial population is basically a set of valid solutions (individuals) chosen randomly. GAs use chromosomes to represent individuals.

##### Calculating the fitness
- To begin with, fitness function is calculated for each individual. Fitness for each individual is independent of others. Since the next iteration involves the best fitness score, GAs are hence steered by maximum/minimum value(s).
- Then Selection --> Crossover --> Mutation --> Stopping condition

##### Stopping condition
- The two common stopping conditions are:
 - A maximum number of generations have been reached.
 - There was no noticeable improvement over a couple of generations.
- Other stopping conditions include:
 - Predetermined timeout.
 - A certain budget has been depleted.
 - The best individual has taken over a portion of the population larger than a preset threshold.
