### 1. An Introduction to Genetic Algorithms

- Drawing inspiration from Charles Darwin's theory

- Evolutionary computation
  - Genetic algorithms

  1. What are genetic algorithms?
  - A family of search algorithms.
  - By mimicking Darwinian natural selection and reproduction, these algorithms
  can produce high-quality solutions pertaining search, optimization, and learning
  that would otherwise be hard to come by.
  - Suitable for problems with large number of parameters and complex math
  representations.
  - Darwinian evolution
    - *Variation:* Individual traits may vary.
    - *Inheritance:* Some traits are passed on to the offspring.
    - *Resemblance:* Offspring resemble their parents more than unrelated other.
    - *Selection:* Survival of the fittest to reproduce.
    - *Crossover/Recombination:* Offspring have a mix of their parents traits.
    - *Mutation:* Random change(s) to one or more genes.

- The genetic algorithm analogy
  - Whereas Darwinian evolution maintains a population of individual specimens,
  genetic algorithms maintains a population of possible solutions (individuals).

  - Genotype
  This is a collection of genes that are grouped into chromosomes.
  This collection facilitates reproduction and mutation.
  Each chromosome of the offspring will carry a mix of genes from parents genotype.
  e.g. A single gene: `010111010`

  - Population
  A collection of solution for the problem at hand is maintained.
  e.g. A population: `010111010 000101010 110111110 010011011 010110000`

  - Fitness function
  Aka target function. The function/problem we seek to optimize/solve.
  Individuals are evaluated every time based on the fitness function.
  The evolution process stops once the solution has been found within a given
  fitness value.

  - Selection
  Individuals with high fitness value are more likely to be chosen for the next cycle.
  Low fitness may still be selected but with a lower probability.

  - Crossover
  To create a pair of new individuals, two parents are chosen from the current generation. Parts of their chromosome interchanged (crossed over) to create new offspring.

  - Mutation
  Periodically and randomly refresh the population. Introduce new patterns into the chromosomes, and encourage search in uncharted areas of the solution space.

  2. The theory behind genetic algorithms.
  - Behind the concept of genetic algorithms is the *building block hypothesis*. Small building blocks assembled together to obtain an optimal solution to the problem. This is guided by a superior fitness score.

  - The **schema theorem** is the Holland's fundamental theorem of genetic algorithms. Schemata are patterns/templates that can be found within chromosomes.
  e.g. if a set of chromosomes is represented by binary strings, the schema `1*01` represents all those chromosomes that have a `1` in the leftmost position, and `01` in the rightmost position.
